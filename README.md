# Python Programming Language (Intermediate Level) â€“ BTK Academy

This repository contains all the examples and exercises I completed during the **Python Programming Language (Intermediate Level)** course at **BTK Academy**.

Throughout the program, I progressed from the basics of Python to topics such as:

- Strings  
- Lists  
- Operators  
- Conditional Statements  
- Loops  
- Functions  
- Modules  
- Error Handling  
- File Operations  

I have also included the Python Programming Language Intermediate Certificate awarded at the end of the course.

## Course Content and What I Learned

### Introduction to Python
- Using the `print()` command to display output  
- Declaring variables, basic data types (numbers, strings)  
- Receiving input from the user and type conversions  

### Strings
- Working with the string data type  
- Indexing and slicing  
- Built-in methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`, `.split()` etc.  
- Formatting strings and various string operations  

### Lists
- Creating lists, indexing and slicing  
- List operations: adding, deleting, updating  
- Built-in list methods: `append()`, `remove()`, `insert()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`  
- Working with nested lists  

### Operators
- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`  
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`  
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`  
- Membership and identity operators: `in`, `is`  

### Conditional Statements
- Evaluating conditions with `if`, `elif`, `else`  
- Using comparison and logical operators in conditions  
- Nested conditionals  

### Loops
- Performing repeated operations with `for` and `while`  
- Iterating over ranges (`range`) and iterable data structures  
- Loop control: `break`, `continue`  
- Nested loops  

### Functions
- Defining functions with `def`  
- Parameters, default and keyword arguments  
- Return values (`return`)  
- Function scope  

### Modules
- Using built-in modules such as `math` and `random`  
- Syntax of `import` and `from ... import ...`  
- Creating and using custom module files  

### Error Handling and File Operations
- Handling errors with `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`  
- Raising custom errors with `raise`  
- Opening and closing files  
- Reading and writing modes (`r`, `w`, `a`)  
- Processing file contents line by line
